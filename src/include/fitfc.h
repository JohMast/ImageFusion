 * @brief The RegressionMapper computes the regression model and the residual
 * @param opt are the Fit-FC options. Used to get the window size via
 * @ref FitFCOptions::getWinSize() "getWinSize()" and the number of threads
 * @ref FitFCOptions::getNumberThreads() const "getNumberThreads()" to use.
 *
 * @param h1 is the high resolution image at date 1. This will be used for x.
 * @param l1 is the low resolution image at date 1. This will be used for x.
 * @param l2 is the low resolution image at date 2. This will be used for y.
 * @param m is either empty or a single-channel mask. The masked out pixels are not used for
 * regression and not for mapping. Their output is undefined (unchanged).
 *
 * This fusor is used by calling FitFCFusor::regress(), which uses CallBaseTypeFunctor::run(). All
 * the input images are shared copies in size of the sample area. The result will be influenced by
 * the border with a width of the half window size.
 *
 * This functor iterates through all pixels. For each pixel it uses a window around that central
 * pixel. It regresses a linear model from `l1` to `l2` using all pixels of the window (no
 * filtering here). To be more specific, `l1` is considered as x and `l2` as y to regress a and b
 * in the model \f$ y = a\,x + b \f$ by using least squares method. Then this linear model is used
 * to map the central pixel of `h1` to `h2` (prediction), i. e. \f$ h_2 = a\,h_1 + b \f$. Also the
 * residual of the central pixel from `l1` to `l2` is saved, i. e. \f$ R = l_2 - (a\,l_1 + b) \f$.
 *
 * The regression requires some sums of the low resolution images over all pixels in a window. The
 * sums of moving windows can be calculated very efficiently. Its basic idea is to start with an
 * initial sum and add the new values and subtract the old. In a 1D moving sum, this would be like
 * follows:
 *
 *     | 1 + 6 + 3 + 2 | 8   4   would be 12. Moving one to the right
 *       -               +
 *       1 | 6 + 3 + 2 + 8 | 4   would be 12 - 1 + 8 = 19. And again
 *           -               +
 *       1   6 | 3 + 2 + 8 + 4 | would be 19 - 6 + 4 = 17.
 *
 * This is how this helper computes the sums, but in 2D, for the sum of l1, l2, l1*l1 and l1*l2 as
 * well as the pixel count (can vary at borders and by masks). This allows for a runtime complexity
 * of \f$ c \, W \, H \f$ instead of \f$ d \, W \, H \, S^2 \f$ with a naive approach, where \f$ c,
 * d\f$ are some constants, \f$ W \f$ and \f$ H \f$ are the width and height of the image (or
 * actually the sample area) and \f$ S \f$ is the window size (by default 51).
 *
 * Note: This whole procedure is done for each channel separately. So the most outer loop iterates
 * over the channels. This loop is also parallelized, since due to the independency of the
 * channels, there are no problems and no overhead.
 *
 * @return two images. First is the predicted image, which is in the paper denoted by
 * \f$ \hat F_{\mathrm{RM}} \f$. It has the same data type, size and number of channels as `h1`.
 * The second is the coarse residual, which has the same size and number of channels, but is of
 * type double (Type::float64).

/**
 * @brief The FitFCFusor class is the implementation of the Fit-FC algorithm
 *
 * Fit-FC is *a three-step method consisting of regression model fitting (RM fitting), spatial
 * filtering (SF) and residual compensation (RC)*. It requires a relatively low amount of
 * computation time for prediction.
 *
 * For Fit-FC three images on two dates are required. The date 1 is the input image pair date and
 * date 2 is the prediction date, see the following table:
 * <table>
 * <caption id="fitfc_3_image_structure">Fit-FC image structure with three images</caption>
 *   <tr><td><span style="display:inline-block; width: 6em;"></span>date<br>
 *           resolution</td>
 *       <td align="center" valign="top">1</td>
 *       <td align="center" valign="top">2</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr><td>High</td>
 *       <td align="center"><table><tr><th style="width: 6em;">High 1</th></tr></table></td>
 *       <td align="center"><table><tr><td align="center" bgcolor="red" style="width: 6em;"><b>High 2</b></td></tr></table></td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr><td>Low</td>
 *       <td align="center"><table><tr><th style="width: 6em;">Low 1</th></tr></table></td>
 *       <td align="center"><table><tr><th style="width: 6em;">Low 2</th></tr></table></td>
 *   </tr>
 * </table>
 * Note, despite the numbering, date 1 can actually be a date after date 2.
 *
 * Fit-FC basically iterates through all pixels in an image. For each pixel (called center pixel)
 * it regresses a linear model with all pixels of a surrounding window from Low 1 to Low 2. This
 * model maps the central pixel of High 1 to the non-existing High 2.
 *
 * After this is done for every pixel Fit-FC iterates again through all pixels. But now it selects
 * the N most similar pixels and uses their regressed value, adds the filtered residual (of the
 * regression) and weights them.
 *
 * There are differences of this implementation to the algorithm described in the original paper.
 * These are listed here:
 *
 *  * The paper does not define which pixels should be preferred in filtering stage, when the `N`th
 *    and `(N+1)`th pixels (and maybe more) have equal differences. We propose to prefer the closer
 *    pixels. So the ordering is determined by
 *    \f$ (D_i < D_j) \vee (D_i = D_j \wedge (x_i - x_c)^2 + (y_i - y_c)^2 < (x_j - x_c)^2 + (y_j - y_c)^2) \f$.
 *  * In general, DataFusor%s in the image fusion framework are not imposed to do preprocessing.
 *    Although it would be possible to handle that, it would lead to inconsistent handling and so the
 *    input images are assumed to have the same resolution (low resolution is already upscaled /
 *    warped). The Fit-FC algorithm as described in the paper includes upsampling as part of the
 *    algorithm. So to be close to the paper the low resolution images should use nearest neighbor
 *    method when upsampled.
 *  * The regression of the coefficients a and b in the regression model is not described well in
 *    the paper. There must be used more than one coarse pixel for regression, otherwise the residual
 *    would vanish. So the window must in principle be able to cover multiple coarse pixels. In that
 *    case it is not completely clear how a coarse pixel, which is not completely included in the
 *    window, is used. It might be weighted by the coverage of the window, but the paper does not
 *    state anything about it. However, this implementation does exactly that, since it is natural to
 *    do that when the images have the same resolution. So when the low resolution images were
 *    upscaled with the nearest neighbor method, there are blocks of pixels with the same values.
 *    When multiple of these pixels are covered of the window, the values are used multiple times,
 *    which is equivalent to weight the coarse pixels with the coverage. However, if the paper did
 *    not meant to do that (and probably it would describe that weighting if it had meant that), we
 *    do that differently. We also do not get a blocky regression model because of that, but rather a
 *    bilinear filtered one, because the coverage weights are behaving bilinearly.
 *
 * Parallelization is done implicitly and the usage of @ref Parallelizer "Parallelizer<FitFCFusor>"
 * is forbidden with this algorithm. The reason is that the filtering of the residual would cause
 * different results, when the prediction area was split up for parallelization.
